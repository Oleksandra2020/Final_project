You do not need to install anyhting. I plan to allocate this project on pythonanywhere.com,
so the url will be added later

### *Usage*

In progress...

### *Current version of repository includes:*

- examples folder: 
    - an example of using youtube-transcripts-api 
    - json file the module in the folder returns
- module folder:
    - csv_reader.py: processes csv data necessary for the research
    - data_cleaner.py: saves clean information(modifies json files like an example folder has)
    - data_collector.py: retrieves data from api and saves it in json-format in data folder
- data: a few examples of processed data that I will use for further research
